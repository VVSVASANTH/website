        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.It is used to design web pages using a markup language.HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language.Hypertext defines the link between web pages.A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable.The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. </p>

            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page. It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colours, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.</p>

            <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.

                JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed). JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. </p>

            <h2>REACT JS</h2>
            <p>ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is an open-source, component-based front-end library that is responsible only for the view layer of the application. ReactJS is not a framework, it is just a library developed by Facebook to solve some problems that we were facing earlier.</p>

            <h2>NODE JS</h2>
            <P>Node JS is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. It provides an event-driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O and cross-platform runtime environment for building highly scalable server-side applications using JavaScript.
                Most people are confused and understand it’s a framework or a programing language. We often use NodeJS for building back-end services like APIs, Web App, or Mobile App. It’s utilized in production by large companies like Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart, etc.

AngularJS is a Javascript open-source front-end framework that is mainly used to develop single-page web applications(SPAs). It is a continuously growing and expanding framework which provides better ways for developing web applications.

            <p>The term PHP is an acronym for Hypertext Preprocessor. It is an open-source, interpreted, object-oriented server-side scripting language that is used for web development. PHP is developed by the Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 with the very first version of PHP that simply designed to set the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) binaries, which are written in C programming language. The latest version of PHP is PHP versions 8 which is released on November 24, 2022. It can be easily embedded with HTML files. HTML codes can also be written in a PHP file. The PHP codes are executed on the server-side whereas HTML codes are directly executed on the browser.</p>
